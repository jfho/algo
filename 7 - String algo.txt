* Describe: How do you solve Bing using a trie. Which augmentations do you need to apply to a standard trie?

    one solution is to add a count field to every node. this allows for constant lookup time for finding the the number of children the node has. whenever the recursive insert method goes down that node to add a new child somewhere down its tree, the count is increased by 1.


* Describe: How does string hashing compute the hash 
code of a string. What is the role of a and p?

    a simple way would be to compute:
    x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[m-1]
    
    this can result in string "abcd" and string "dcba" giving same hash value tho, so we add weight to position of every character like so:
    x[0] * a^(m-1) + x[1] * a^(m-2) * ... * x[m-1] * a^0
    here a can be any constant.

    this can result in very very big result if string is long and possibly integer overflow, so we modulo by a number p to make result smaller
    (x[0] * a^(m-1) + x[1] * a^(m-2) * ... * x[m-1] * a^0) mod p

    by making p a mersenne prime number, computing the modulo is faster since it can be done using bit fuckery (dunno if i'm expected to know how exactly lol)


* Let's say a is 11 and p is 37. How does the 
polynomial for the string "APS" look like? (no 
evaluation, not important to get the ordinal 
representations of the characters right.)

    ( 'A' * 11^(3-1) * 'P' * 11^(3-2) * 'S' * 11^(3-3) ) mod 37 =
    (65 * 11^2 * 80 * 11 * 83 * 1) mod 37 =
    574459600 mod 37 =
    5


* What is the probability that two different strings of 
length m hash to the same integer?

    m/p, so p is usually chosen to be a large prime such that the chances are lower. by using modulo, the result can be anywhere between 1 and p, so larger p gives more possibilities.


* What is an efficient way to compute the coefficients 
a^{i} for i in {0, ..., m - 1}?

    by creating an array where the values are [a^0 mod p, a^1 mod p, ..., a^m-1 mod p].
    the efficiency comes by calculating each value using the previous value, since every new value simply adds another a.
    we construct an array d where d[k] = a^k mod p:
        d[0] = 1
        d[k] = (d[k âˆ’ 1] * a) mod p



* Discuss: How can dvaput be solved using string hashing?

    since the string has to be repeated, start from half the length of the string and compute the hash of the first half - store this hash. then go one character forward at a time (rolling) and compare, checking if the initial hash is ever found. if not, use binary search and half the length and check if a repeated substring exists. if so, check if a substring exists of length halfway between first and second attempt etc. return longest length substring found.
